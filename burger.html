        <p>Delicious home-made burger right in the comforts of your own home</p>


        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 slices white bread</li>
                    <li>1 (4 ounce) beef hamburger patty</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>1 egg</ls>
                    <li>1 slice American cheese </li>
                </ul>
        </p>


        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <p><li>Place the bread in a toaster set to your desired level of darkness. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the hamburger patty for about 5 minutes per side, until cooked through. While the patty is cooking, spread mayonnaise on one side of each piece of toasted bread and place them on a plate, mayonnaise side up.</li></p>
                <p><li>Once the patty is cooked through, transfer it to one slice of bread. Crack the egg into the skillet and fry until the yolk is firm, about 3 minutes if you cover the pan. Place the egg onto the patty when done and top with a slice of cheese. Top with the other slice of bread. When finished, it should look like a sandwich.</li></p>
            </ol>
